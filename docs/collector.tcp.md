## Metrics

Name | Description | Type | Labels
-----|-------------|------|-------
`windows_tcp_connection_failures_total` | Number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from the SYN-SENT state or the SYN-RCVD state, plus the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition from the SYN-RCVD state to the LISTEN state | counter | af
`windows_tcp_connections_active_total` |  Number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition from the CLOSED state to the SYN-SENT state.| counter | af
`windows_tcp_connections_established` | Number of TCP connections for which the current state is either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT. | gauge | af
`windows_tcp_connections_passive_total` | Number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition from the LISTEN state to the SYN-RCVD state. | counter | af
`windows_tcp_connections_reset_total` | Connections Reset is the number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or the CLOSE-WAIT state. | counter | af
`windows_tcp_segments_total` | Total segments sent or received using the TCP protocol | counter | af
`windows_tcp_segments_received_total` | Total segments received, including those received in error. This count includes segments received on currently established connections | counter | af
`windows_tcp_segments_retransmitted_total` | Total segments retransmitted. That is, segments transmitted that contain one or more previously transmitted bytes | counter | af
`windows_tcp_segments_sent_total` | Total segments sent, including those on current connections, but excluding those containing *only* retransmitted bytes | counter | af
`windows_tcp_connections_state_count` | Number of TCP connections by state among: CLOSED, LISTENING, SYN_SENT, SYN_RECEIVED, ESTABLISHED, FIN_WAIT1, FIN_WAIT2, CLOSE_WAIT, CLOSING, LAST_ACK, TIME_WAIT, DELETE_TCB | gauge | af
