A page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its working set in main memory. The page may not be retrieved from disk if it is on the standby list and therefore already in main memory. The page also may not be retrieved if it is in use by another process which shares the page.                                                                                                  | counter | `session_name`  |

Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.                                                                                                                                                                                      | gauge   | `session_name`  |

Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.                                                                                                                                                                                      | gauge   | `session_name`  |

| `windows_terminal_services_processor_time_seconds_total`         | total elapsed time that all of the threads of this process used the processor to execute instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Counter | `session_name`  |
| `windows_terminal_services_user_time_seconds_total`              | total elapsed time that this process's threads have spent executing code in user mode. Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Counter | `session_name`  |
| `windows_terminal_services_pool_non_paged_bytes`                 | Number of bytes in the non-paged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated. This property displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.                                                                                                                                                                                             | gauge   | `session_name`  |

## Useful queries

Use metrics can be combined with other metrics to create useful queries. For example, with remote_fx metrics:

```
windows_remote_fx_net_loss_rate * on(session_name) group_left(user) (windows_terminal_services_session_info == 1)
```
