### Example metric
Show current number of processes
```
windows_os_processes{instance="localhost"}
```

## Useful queries
Find all devices not set to UTC timezone
```
windows_os_timezone{timezone != "UTC"}
```

Show memory usage for instance (%)
```
100 - 100 * windows_os_physical_memory_free_bytes{instance="localhost"} / windows_os_physical_memory_total_bytes{instance="localhost"}
```

## Alerting examples
**prometheus.rules**
```yaml
# Alert on hosts that have exhausted all available physical memory
- alert: MemoryExhausted
  expr: windows_os_physical_memory_free_bytes == 0
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: high
  annotations:
    summary: "Host {{ $labels.instance }} is out of memory"
    description: "{{ $labels.instance }} has exhausted all available physical memory"

# Alert on hosts with greater than 90% memory usage
- alert: MemoryLow
  expr: 100 - 100 * windows_os_physical_memory_free_bytes / windows_os_physical_memory_total_bytes > 90
  for: 10m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "Memory usage for host {{ $labels.instance }} is greater than 90%"
```
