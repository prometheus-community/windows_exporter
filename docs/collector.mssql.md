### Example metric

Query Full table scans

```
rate(windows_mssql_accessmethods_full_scans{instance='host:9182'}[$__rate_interval])

```
## Useful queries

### Database file size
This collector retrieves the two values (data file and log file) and sums the total in PromQL to give the Database file size.

```
windows_mssql_databases_data_files_size_bytes{database='DatabaseName',instance='host:9182'} + windows_mssql_databases_log_files_size_bytes{database='DatabaseName',instance='host:9182'}

```

### Buffer Cache Hit Ratio

When you read the counter in perfmon you will get the the percentage pages found in the buffer cache. This percentage is calculated internally based on the total number of cache hits divided by the total number of cache lookups over the last few thousand page accesses.
This collector retrieves the two internal values separately. In order to calculate the Buffer Cache Hit Ratio in PromQL.

```
windows_mssql_bufman_buffer_cache_hits{instance="host:9182", mssql_instance="MSSQLSERVER"} /
windows_mssql_bufman_buffer_cache_lookups{instance="host:9182", mssql_instance="MSSQLSERVER"}
```

This principal can be used for following metrics too:
- AccessMethodsWorktablesFromCacheHitRatio
  - accessmethods_worktables_from_cache_hits
  - accessmethods_worktables_from_cache_lookups
- LogCacheHitRatio
  - databases_log_cache_hits
  - databases_log_cache_lookups
- AverageLockWaitTime
  - locks_wait_time_seconds
  - locks_count

## Alerting examples

    for: 5m  # Trigger the alert if the condition persists for 5 mins
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
