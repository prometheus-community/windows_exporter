# time collector

The time collector exposes the Windows Time Service metrics. Note that the Windows Time Service must be running, else metric collection will fail.
If the Windows Time Service is stopped after collection has started, collector metric values will reset to 0.

Please note the Time Service perflib counters are only available on [Windows Server 2016 or newer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/windows-time-service/windows-server-2016-improvements).

| `windows_time_clock_frequency_adjustment_ppb_total` | Total adjustment made to the local system clock frequency by W32Time in parts per billion (PPB) units. 1 PPB adjustment implies the system clock was adjusted at a rate of 1 nanosecond per second (1 ns/s). The smallest possible adjustment can vary and is expected to be in the order of 100's of PPB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | counter | None       |
| `windows_time_computed_time_offset_seconds`         | The absolute time offset between the system clock and the chosen time source, as computed by the W32Time service in microseconds. When a new valid sample is available, the computed time is updated with the time offset indicated by the sample. This time is the actual time offset of the local clock. W32Time initiates clock correction by using this offset and updates the computed time in between samples with the remaining time offset that needs to be applied to the local clock. Clock accuracy can be tracked by using this performance counter with a low polling interval (for example, 256 seconds or less) and looking for the counter value to be smaller than the desired clock accuracy limit. | gauge   | None       |
| `windows_time_ntp_client_time_sources`              | Active number of NTP Time sources being used by the client. This is a count of active, distinct IP addresses of time servers that are responding to this client's requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | gauge   | None       |
| `windows_time_ntp_round_trip_delay_seconds`         | Total roundtrip delay experienced by the NTP client in receiving a response from the server for the most recent request, in seconds. This is the time elapsed on the NTP client between transmitting a request to the NTP server and receiving a valid response from the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | gauge   | None       |
